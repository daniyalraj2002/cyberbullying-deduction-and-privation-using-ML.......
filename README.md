The proposed cyberbullying detection system uses **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** and ML (TF-IDF, CNN, LSTM) for superior, real-time accuracy. It overcomes the limitations of existing systems, which suffer from dataset imbalance and reduced performance due to resampling techniques like IHT.
